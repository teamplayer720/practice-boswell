###    favorite tv show is Andor


I like this show because of how it follows a side story called

**Rouge One**. This show helps fill in the gaps left before Rouge one and 

help establish the main story even more. I also like this show because of the 

sound design. The way they follow the main themes from **Star Wars**, and mix it within

the,main music gives it such a unique feel.
